## Project Directions
 The run_analysis.R script does the following: 
 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set  
    with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.  

========================================
## Script Description:
 The 'run_analysis.R' script tidies and saves accelerometer data from Samsung Galaxy S phones 
 and creates a second dataset with analysis (average) for each variable.

========================================
## Dataset Files:
'readme.md'
'codebook.md' - Shows information on identifiers and variables in dataset.
'UCIHAR_averageData.txt' - A .txt file copy of dataset with each column separated by ' '. 
   Feature variables are averaged and given for each subject/activity.
'./UCI HAR Dataset' - A copy of the UCI HAR dataset.
